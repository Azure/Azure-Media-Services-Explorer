Azure-Media-Services-Explorer
=============================

Azure Media Services Explorer (AMSE) is a Winforms/C# application for Windows that does upload, download, encode and stream VOD and live content with [Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/).

See a full description on http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/08/managing-media-workflows-with-the-new-azure-media-services-explorer-tool

**The latest binary for Windows (with a EXE installer) is available in the [releases section](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer/releases)**. Please note that AMSE v4 is for AMS v2 (master branch), and AMSE v5 is for AMS v3 API (rpv3 branch).

There are some nice [Azure Media Services Step-by-Step tutorials](https://www.slideshare.net/shigeyf/azure-media-services-stepbystep-tutorial-docs-series-agenda) using Azure Media Services Explorer.

This solution has been developped with Visual Studio 2015/2017. It contains two projects: "AMSExplorer", the main application, and "SetupAMSExplorer", an InstallShield project that creates a Setup executable (EXE/MSI).

In order to compile this setup project, which is optional, you should install [InstallShield 2018 Lite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flexera-InstallShield-Lite.InstallShield2018Lite).
