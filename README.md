Azure-Media-Services-Explorer
=============================

Azure Media Services Explorer (AMSE) is a Winforms/C# application for Windows that does upload, download, encode and stream VOD and live content with [Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/).

See a full description on http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/08/managing-media-workflows-with-the-new-azure-media-services-explorer-tool

**The latest binary for Windows (with a EXE installer) is available in the [releases section](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer/releases)** and also on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/amsexplorer).

This solution has been developped with Visual Studio 2015. It contains two projects: "AMSExplorer", the main application, and "SetupAMSExplorer", an InstallShield project that creates a Setup executable (EXE/MSI).

In order to compile this setup project, you must install InstallShield Limited Edition for VisualStudio. To do this:
- Launch Visual Studio 2015
- Select New project
- Select Installed / Other Project Types / InstallShield Limited Edition Project
- This should trigger the process to install and activate InstallShield.
