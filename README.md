# Azure Media Services Explorer (for AMS v3)
Azure Media Services Explorer (AMSE) is a Winforms/C# application for Windows that does upload, download, encode and stream VOD and live content with [Azure Media Services v3](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/).

See a full description on http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/08/managing-media-workflows-with-the-new-azure-media-services-explorer-tool

**The latest binary for Windows (with a MSI installer) is available in the [releases section](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer/releases)**. Please note that AMSE v5 is for AMS v3 API (main branch), and AMSE v4 is for AMS v2 (AMSv2 branch).

This solution has been developped with Visual Studio 2019. It contains two projects: "AMSExplorer", the main application, and "SetupAMSExplorer", an InstallShield project that creates a Setup executable (EXE/MSI).

In order to compile this setup project, which is optional, you should install [InstallShield Lite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flexera-InstallShield-Lite.InstallShield2018Lite).
