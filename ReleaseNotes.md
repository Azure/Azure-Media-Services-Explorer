Version 5.0.13.0 (November 26, 2019) brings the following features and improvements:

* AMSE uses a new way to generate asset name for output asset. Output asset name is now based on source asset name + Transform name + a short random GUID. This should make the search for assets easier : for example, using the search option "Asset name (starts with)" and specifying the source asset name should now return related output assets too.
* Nugget packages update
* Bug fixes
